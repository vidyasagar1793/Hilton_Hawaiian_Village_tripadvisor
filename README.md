# Hilton Hawaiian Hotel Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of guest reviews and ratings for the Hilton Hawaiian Hotel. The analysis encompasses the use of Python, BeautifulSoup, SQL, R, and Tableau to gather, clean, preprocess, and visualize data.

## Key Components

- **Data Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup):** The project utilizes Python, specifically BeautifulSoup, to scrape data from TripAdvisor. This process focuses on gathering guest reviews and ratings to provide a rich dataset for analysis.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with SQL:** SQL is employed for cleaning and preprocessing the gathered data. This ensures data accuracy and prepares the dataset for subsequent analysis.

- **Sentiment Analysis with R:** The R language is used for sentiment analysis, categorizing reviews based on their sentiment. This step provides valuable insights into customer opinions and feelings expressed in the reviews.

- **Tableau Dashboard for Visualization:** The project includes an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes various aspects such as star reviews, the period of stay, traveler type, and the distribution of customers by continent. This visualization enhances the understanding of the data and makes it accessible for stakeholders.
